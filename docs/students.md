## How to submit your weekly home assignments

Fork the repo or create a new branch in this repo.

- Locate the chapter assignment for the GitHub issue in the course project. Let's say it's [Chapter 1-3: Assignment](#5)
- In the assignment folder, create a new folder with your GitHub account ID in [/assignments/Chapter_1-3/solutions](../assignments/Chapter_1-3/solutions), replacing `Chapter_1-3` with the corresponding week's chapters
- Add the needed files to complete the assignment
- Create a PR back to this repo for the `main` branch, titled with the assignment issue title and including `#ID`. Also, add the assignment issue ID as `#ID` in the PR's description.
  In this case, the title is `Chapter 1-3: Assignment #5 `, and the id to add to the description is `#5` (this will be converted to a link to the issue by GitHub on view)
- Assign the PR to mentors for review
- Follow up on any comments and questions, pushing additional changes to the PR's branch until the PR is merged
