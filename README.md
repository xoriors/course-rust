# qa-manual-course

This course is based on [ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level, CTFL](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level-ctfl-v4-0/) v4.0.1 from 2024. You can access it at [ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf](docs/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf).  
That course is mostly theoretical, but we add practical examples after each chapter and weekly home assignments.

**
The main idea of this repo is to give you, at a minimum:
- A complete QA manual theoretical course based on `ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level, CTFL`
- Additional practical examples and tasks
- Docs, logistics, a project, and GitHub issues to organize the course interactively
- All this Free and Open Source (FOSS)
**

## Structure

- Start with a short intro call
