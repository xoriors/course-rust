# course-rust

This course is based on [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). We also add practical examples for each chapter, weekly assignments, and final projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **WORK IN PROGRESS**
> 
> The main idea of this repo is to give you, at a minimum:
> - A complete Rust course based on `The Rust Book`
> - Additional practical examples and assignments
> - Docs, logistics, a project, and GitHub issues to organize the course interactively
> - All this Free and Open Source (FOSS)

## Prerequesites

- Conversational English is mandatory
- You should be familiar with the basics of programming, algorithms and data structures, and another programming language, preferably with any of C/C++, Go, Java, Kotlin, Python, Haskell, JavaScript, TypeSript or similar
- Know how to use GitHub
- Curiosity, able to learn by yourself
- No specific higher education level is needed

## Advantages of taking the course

- **Why should I take this course:** - To be   initiated in Rust, to understand some advanced programming concepts better
- **What does the course offer**: - Technical support, Recommended courses, Guided self-learning, Flexibility in organizing your learning schedule, free, no obligations          
- **What does the course NOT offer** - Certification, assisted learning, job opportunities

## What this course gives you and what is **NOT**

### What it gives you:

- Useful materials to help you learn Rust
- Short weekly interactive calls (2h) with teachers to teach you and answer your questions
- Technical support and ability to talk  the mentors to them over GitHub issues or chat over the week
- Practical examples and weekly assignments
- It's free, with no obligations

### What it's **NOT**:

- Exhaustive learning course with everyday sessions with teachers
- Paid course
- Learn at your own pace
- It doesn't offer you a job

## Structure

- Will last for min 8 weeks + final project
- Each week, students will read a few chapters from `The Rust Book`
- Home assignments for read chapters. You're encouraged to also [learn by doing](https://github.com/xoriors/course-rust/wiki/Additional-resources#learn-by-doing) using these resources
- Will build a project from scratch for the whole duration of the course (a mini-Redis distributed on replica mode with a load balancer) run from CLI as server and client, and also as libraries
- Every week, we'll have a 2h call where we:
  - Discuss last week's assignment
  - Discuss the last week's chapter and address any questions (this will also happen over the week via Slack or GitHub issues)
  - Briefly present and discuss the next week's course
  - Discuss practical examples
  - Live coding or present building part of the course main app related to last week's chapters knowledge
  - Give a new assignment for last week's chapter
- Over the week, students may ask any questions over the chat
- Weekly calls will be video recorded and made available in this repo for anybody to use

# What you will be able to build from scratch after you take the course

- Relational SQL database
- NoSQL Verisioned key-value/document database
- URL shortener
- Website/service health checker
- Encrypted filesystem
- Distributed filesystem
- File sync service
- Load balancer
- Proxy
